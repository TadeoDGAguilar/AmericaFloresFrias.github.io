This repository contains a Python-based simulation to model the dynamics of primordial black hole (PBH) mergers in dense astrophysical clusters, extending the formalism developed by García-Bellido et al. (2021–2022). It focuses on computing the gravitational wave (GW) emission from both binary black hole (BBH) captures and close hyperbolic encounters (CHEs), including all interaction combinations between PBHs of different generations.
