      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

# About Me

I am a member of the Advanced Institute of Cosmology and a doctoral candidate in Theoretical and Computational Physics at the Institute of Physical Sciences (ICF) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca, Morelos. I conduct my research under the supervision of Dr. Juan Carlos Hidalgo Cuéllar (ICF-UNAM) and Dr. Guillem Domènech Fuertes (Institute for Theoretical Physics, Leibniz Universität Hannover). My work focuses on early-universe cosmology, particularly on the formation and evolution of primordial black holes and the generation of gravitational waves.

I hold a Master’s degree in Physics from the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Chiapas (UNACH), and an Engineering degree in Computer Systems from the University of Valle del Grijalva (UVG), which has provided me with a broad set of technical and computational skills that support my current research.

I have worked as a software programmer focused on basic science, engaging in multidisciplinary activities with Autonomous University of Chiapas (UNACH) and Mesoamerican Centre for Theoretical Physics (MCTP), under the supervision of Dr. Karen S. Caballero. One of my recent developments is PBH-Beta, a computational tool designed to calculate the abundance of primordial black holes under various cosmological scenarios. Additionally, I have collaborated with my colleagues, engineers Edgar Delgado Díaz and Walter Armando Aguilar, to develop a mobile application for the cultural promotion of activities during the Fiesta Grande de Enero in Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas.

Throughout my academic journey, I have participated in various scientific events, including the II University Meeting of Thermodynamics organized by the Department of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering at the University of Sonora (US), the IV Workshop on Numerical and Statistical Methods in Cosmology held in Cuernavaca, Morelos, and The First Mesoamerican Workshop on High Performance Computing, Associated Technologies and Applications organized by the MCTP, among others.

In parallel with my scientific work, I am actively involved in science outreach projects aimed at the general public, youth, and children. I have co-authored popular science articles published in outlets such as La Unión de Morelos.

My current interests combine early-universe physics, the development of numerical tools, creative science communication, and a strong commitment to cultural identity.
